# Project Description

## Objective

The objective of this project is to evaluate your skills in iOS development, focusing on your
architecture and design patterns, especially the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern. This
task is designed to be simple and should be completed within approximately 3 hours.

## Requirements

```
Framework : Swift
Architecture : MVVM
API : JSONPlaceholder
UI Framework : UIKit
```
## Project Description

Create a simple iOS application with the following features:

## Screen 1: User List

```
Fetch a list of users from the JSONPlaceholder API.
Display the list of users in a simple table view.
Each cell should display at least the user's name and email.
```
## Screen 2: User Detail

```
When a user selects a user from the list, navigate to a detail screen.
Display the user's detailed information including name, email, phone, and website.
```
## Architecture

```
MVVM : The project should follow the MVVM design pattern.
```

```
Networking Layer : Implement a network layer to fetch data from the API.
Repository Pattern : Use a repository pattern or a similar approach to manage data
operations.
Navigation : Implement navigation from the user list to the user detail screen.
```
### Nice to Have

```
Unit Tests : Adding unit tests for your view models and network layer.
Inline Comments : Use comments to explain your thought process and decision-making.
```
## What We're Looking For

```
Adherence to MVVM : Clear separation of concerns.
Networking : How you handle API calls and data parsing.
Repository Pattern : Usage of repository pattern or similar for data management.
Data Passing : How data is passed between screens.
Code Quality : Clean, readable, and maintainable code.
Comments : Use comments to explain your thought process and decision-making
(optional if you include unit tests).
```
## Submission

Please submit your project via a GitHub repository. Ensure your code is well-documented and
includes instructions on how to run the project.

This is a generic task, and we are primarily interested in understanding your coding style and
architectural decisions. Good luck, and we look forward to reviewing your submission!
